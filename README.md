# Advent Of Code 2022
My solutions to the puzzles in https://adventofcode.com/2022


## How to run

From the root directory run
`cargo run bin --dayXX Y`
where XX is they day (number 01-25) and Y is the problem (a or b).

## Notes

* Compile to WASM and build simple html frontend to see how we can run it through the browser?
* Have everything in lib, and bin just launches function? Then tests could be used for performance.
